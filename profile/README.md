# Archipelago Manager
Manager for [Archipelago](https://github.com/Archipelago-Manager) servers, built for ease of use and increased functionality like configuration management, users, easily host several games, discord integration, notifications etc.
Started as a project because I wanted some easier way to get information about progress while running async games, it then turned into a fully fledged SaaS development project.

Projects is made to be fully open source and self-hostable, but will also server as a way to learn hosting a SaaS and sold as a service for people who do not want to bother with hosting it themselves.
